# FTPdirect
---

## Motivation

While collaborating with developers even in the same country, I found that transferring large files was 
rather cumbersome.
Mail and conferencing clients have limit data transfer, and if you are fortunate enough to have access 
to a secure server with port forwarding, maybe it is possible to share a link to a collaborator to download the file.
More often than not, though, these servers are accessible to a private network and you can only 
access them if you can tunnel into it.

This is the reason I developed FTPdirect: to provide a peer-to-peer file transfer with symmetric encryption.
It is intended to be used while in contact with a peer in order to share the P2P address and assure 
a symmetric Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
